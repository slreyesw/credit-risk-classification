## Overview of the Analysis


The purpose of this analysis is to find a machine learning model that works best for identifying healthy loans and high risk loans.
The financial information provided in asddition to if the loan was healthy or high risk included: loan size, interest rates, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks on credit reports, and toal debt.


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    *99% accuracy
    *Precision identifying healthy loans: 1
    *Recall of identifying healthy loans: 1
    *Precision identifying high risk loans: .87
    *Recall of identifying high risk loans: .89


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    *100% accuracy
    *Precision identifying healthy loans: 1
    *Recall of identifying healthy loans: 1
    *Precision identifying high risk loans: .87
    *Recall of identifying high risk loans: 1


## Summary

Both models are skilled at identifying healthy loans more than they are at identifying high risk loans. The 2nd machine learning model has better recall and precision overall at predicting high risk loans, which may be more important to a lender.

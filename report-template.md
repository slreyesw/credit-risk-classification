## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to find a machine learning model that works best for identifying healthy loans and high risk loans.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The financial information provided in addition to if the loan was healthy or high risk included: loan size, interest rates, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks on credit reports, and toal debt.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.

* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    *99% accuracy
    *Precision identifying healthy loans: 1
    *Recall of identifying healthy loans: 1
    *Precision identifying high risk loans: .87
    *Recall of identifying high risk loans: .89




* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    *100% accuracy
    *Precision identifying healthy loans: 1
    *Recall of identifying healthy loans: 1
    *Precision identifying high risk loans: .87
    *Recall of identifying high risk loans: 1


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
